print('Once upon a time, a bright-eyed college student called Emily started her adventure into coding in a busy dorm. Equipped with a strong will and inquisitiveness, she established her initial GitHub account and embarked on a mission to master the realm of programming.')
print('She typed her first "Hello, World!" script with apprehension, an exciting but modest first step that signaled the start of her coding journey.') 
print('She had no idea that this little script would spark a love for coding that would have a profound impact on her future.')
